ViralHook AI 🎵✨
AI-powered music hook analyzer and viral content optimizer for social media platforms.
🎯 Project Vision
The Goal: Create an AI tool that analyzes music files and identifies the most "hook-worthy" parts that will perform best on different social media platforms, then provides optimization recommendations for titles, descriptions, tags, and visual content.
🎵 What This App Does

Upload Music Files - Users can upload audio files for analysis
Find Viral Hooks - AI identifies the most engaging parts of songs (opening hooks, chorus sections, climax moments)
Platform Optimization - Gets specific recommendations for TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, etc.
Content Strategy - Suggests titles, descriptions, tags, and visual approaches
Timing Recommendations - Tells users exactly which 15-30 second clips will perform best on each platform

✅ Current Status - WORKING FEATURES
Backend Server (Node.js/Express)

✅ Server running on http://localhost:5000
✅ File uploads working with multer (50MB limit, audio files only)
✅ Audio metadata extraction using music-metadata library
✅ Basic hook detection algorithm
✅ Platform recommendations for TikTok, Instagram, YouTube
✅ Error handling and logging

API Endpoints

GET /api/health - Health check
POST /api/upload - Upload audio files
POST /api/audio/analyze - Analyze uploaded audio
GET /api/audio/analysis/:filename - Get analysis for specific file

🚀 How to Run

Install dependencies: npm install
Start server: npm run server
Test health: http://localhost:5000/api/health
Upload endpoint: POST to http://localhost:5000/api/upload

🧠 Current AI Logic
Hook Detection Algorithm (Basic)

Opening Hook (0-30s): Attention-grabbing intro
Main Chorus Hook (~25% into song): Most memorable part
Bridge/Climax Hook (~60% into song): Energy peak

Platform Recommendations

TikTok: 15-30s, immediate impact, trending sounds
Instagram Reels: 15-30s, visual transitions, shareable moments
YouTube Shorts: 30-60s, strong opening, vertical optimization
YouTube Regular: 3-5min, teaser upfront, timestamps

🎯 Next Development Phases
Phase 1: Frontend Interface (NEXT)

 React app for file uploads
 Visual waveform display
 Hook timeline interface
 Platform recommendation cards

Phase 2: Advanced AI Integration

 OpenAI integration for content optimization
 Smarter hook detection using audio analysis
 Automated title/description generation
 Visual recommendation engine

Phase 3: Platform Integration

 YouTube API integration
 TikTok API integration
 Instagram API integration
 Direct publishing capabilities
